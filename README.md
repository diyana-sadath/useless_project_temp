# Baadal ‚òÅÔ∏é üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Powerpuff Girls


### Team Members
-Team Lead: Diyana Sadath ‚Äì TKMCE
-Member 2: Asiya Muhammed ‚Äì TKMCE

### Project Description
Have you ever looked up at a cloudy sky and told your friend "that cloud looks like a cat!", only for your friend to say that you need to get your eyes checked...
Well, we're here with Baadal to not only validate your imagination, but also give it some character ‚ú®

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People can see animals in the clouds... but no one has ever documented these cloud creatures. Where‚Äôs the record? The lore? The leaderboard?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We made Baadal, an app that takes your cloud photos, lets an AI hallucinate the animal it sees, gives it a ridiculous backstory, and adds it to the Cloud Lore Wiki.
You can even upvote the weirdest ones and climb the Absurdity Leaderboard.
